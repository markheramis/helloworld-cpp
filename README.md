# Hello World in C++

Welcome to the "Hello World" C++ application repository! This project serves as a simple demonstration of a C++ application that prints "Hello World". The main goal of this repository is to showcase the use of GitHub Actions for building and releasing C++ executables, as well as utilizing Docker for building C++ programs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- A modern C++ compiler
- Git
- Docker

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markheramis/helloworld-cpp.git
cd helloworld-cpp
```

## Build and Run the Application

To build the application, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o hello hello.cpp
```

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
./hello
```

## Docker

This repository also includes a Dockerfile for building a Docker image of the application. To build the Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t hello-cpp .
```

To run the Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -v ./:/app hello-cpp
```

## Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Upon every push to the repository, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build the project and create a release with the built executable.

### Setting up GitHub Actions

Before you can use GitHub Actions, you need to update the workflow permissions. Navigate to your projectâ€™s `Settings` -> `Actions` -> `General` -> `Workflow permissions` and set it to `Read and write permissions`. This allows GitHub Actions to access workflow environment variables like `$GITHUB_TOKEN`.
